# A list of [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) funded companies

## Motivation

It's always helpful to know which companies have been funded by YC, and I needed
that in a machine-readable format to match with [our](https://luckymarmot.com/paw)
customer base.

[yclist.com](http://yclist.com/) is great, but I needed the list in JSON.

## List

The extracted, JSON-formatted list, is in [list.json](list.json). The
quick-and-dirty JSON parser is also available in this repo.

## Credit

All data comes from [yclist.com](http://yclist.com/). Itself mentions:
