# A list of [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) funded companies

## Motivation

It's always helpful to know which companies have been funded by YC, and I needed
a machine-readable list to match with [our](https://luckymarmot.com/paw)
customer base. And [yclist.com](http://yclist.com/) is a great source.

## List

The extracted, JSON-formatted list, is in [list.json](list.json). The
quick-and-dirty parser is also available in this repo.

There's also a Markdown version: [list.md](list.md).

## Credit

All data comes from [yclist.com](http://yclist.com/), which mentions:
